ARN is down.<br><br>
ARN development takes too much of my almost non-existent free time.<br>
Studies, work, life and 4 dev projects. All of that has become too much for me.<br>
It's no joke when I say that I am collapsing under all this workload.<br>
It's just too much. I can't handle it anymore.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I can't finance this project with donations only, there were too little.<br>
To give you a cost breakdown: ARN development took around 500-600 hours in total so far (for the remake only).<br>
This is equivalent to getting around 12.000 $ payment if this was an official job.<br>
Now add the server costs to it which are 15 $ <strong>per month</strong>.<br>
<br>
So how much did I get from donations, in total? After a whole year, since May 2014?<br>
I got 42,19 $. Minus the PayPal fees. If you've read the last paragraph, do the math.<br>
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=WVTG44E8KWFEL" target="_blank">You can still donate</a>
if you can't help with development but want to help me and the project financially.<br>
<br>
Working on ARN requires the dedication and time of a full-time job.<br>
<br>
We really need to either get the financial problem solved or find another developer for ARN.<br>
I know that many people are relying on it (ARN has 1.200 registered accounts at the time of writing this)<br>
and I would rather want this to stay alive like all of you.<br>
Therefore I am asking you to consult your friends: Do you know any developers who are interested in working on this project?<br>
<br>
The requirements for ARN are quite high which is why it's so hard to find another developer:<br>

<ul>
	<li>You need to know <strong>node.js</strong></li>
	<li>You need to know <strong>Aerospike</strong> or at least another NoSQL database</li>
	<li>You need to understand <strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
	<li>You need to understand <strong>JSON</strong></li>
	<li>You need to understand <strong>PHP</strong></li>
	<li>You need to understand <strong>nginx</strong></li>
	<li>You need to understand <strong>Regular Expressions</strong></li>
	<li>You need to know how to use <strong>git</strong> for version control</li>
	<li>You need to know how to administer a <strong>Linux</strong> system from a terminal</li>
	<li>You need to know how to do common <strong>performance optimizations</strong> (e.g. caching)</li>
	<li>It's a bonus if you are familiar with <strong>DigitalOcean</strong></li>
	<li>It's a bonus if you are familiar with <strong>Slack</strong></li>
</ul>

If you feel like you're up to the task please get in touch with me.<br>
If you're not a developer yourself but know a friend who is, please lead him to this site and ask if he or she is interested.
