<b>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</b>

01:30.534 --> 01:35.124
Episode 10: The Orc Lord

01:51.144 --> 01:52.834
<b>G-Great Rimuru?</b>

01:52.834 --> 01:54.684
<b>Is it not to your tastes?</b>

01:56.894 --> 01:59.414
<b>That's so good!</b>

02:05.864 --> 02:08.054
<b>This is bliss!</b>

02:09.054 --> 02:12.524
<b><i>I didn't have a sense of 
taste in my slime form.</i></b>

02:12.524 --> 02:16.544
<b><i>This is the first time I've tasted 
food since I came to this world.</i></b>

02:18.264 --> 02:20.444
<b><i>It's so great to be alive!</i></b>

02:33.674 --> 02:36.844
<b>The Orcs attacked the Ogres?</b>

02:36.844 --> 02:38.394
<b>That can't be!</b>

02:39.534 --> 02:40.684
<b>It's the truth.</b>

02:41.094 --> 02:43.614
<b>Can such a thing really happen?</b>

02:43.614 --> 02:45.254
<b>I don't know.</b>

02:45.254 --> 02:47.624
<b>Is it that strange?</b>

02:47.624 --> 02:48.714
<b>Gobta...</b>

02:48.714 --> 02:50.264
<b>Of course it is.</b>

02:50.264 --> 02:53.494
<b>Ogres are immeasurably stronger than Orcs.</b>

02:53.494 --> 02:56.914
<b>That such a weak race would 
attack them is unthinkable.</b>

02:57.764 --> 03:00.294
<b>Nevertheless, they did come.</b>

03:03.914 --> 03:06.834
<b>They attacked our village out of nowhere.</b>

03:07.964 --> 03:10.424
<b>They carried weapons and wore armor,</b>

03:11.234 --> 03:14.294
<b>and their overwhelming numbers 
filled the entire forest.</b>

03:16.044 --> 03:18.234
<b>Those detestable pigs...</b>

03:18.844 --> 03:21.194
<b>overran our village.</b>

03:21.534 --> 03:23.604
<b>Orcs wearing armor?</b>

03:23.604 --> 03:28.444
<b>Yes, the same type of full 
plate mail that Humans wear.</b>

03:30.644 --> 03:32.284
<b>That must mean...</b>

03:32.694 --> 03:36.044
<b>It's likely the Orcs are not working alone.</b>

03:36.044 --> 03:40.084
<b>Orcs could never round up all 
that valuable armor themselves.</b>

03:41.884 --> 03:43.244
<b>Exactly.</b>

03:43.664 --> 03:45.004
<b>Among them was...</b>

03:48.914 --> 03:51.224
<b>A masked majin?</b>

03:54.224 --> 03:56.184
<b>It was a high-level majin.</b>

03:56.184 --> 03:57.624
<b>I'm certain of it.</b>

03:58.384 --> 04:03.734
<b>And you fought Great Rimuru because
you had mistaken him for this masked majin.</b>

04:03.734 --> 04:04.654
<b>Yes.</b>

04:06.324 --> 04:08.474
<b>So... what does all this mean?</b>

04:08.474 --> 04:14.394
<b>That the Orcs have sided with one 
of the Demon Lords, possibly?</b>

04:15.034 --> 04:16.744
<b>I see... I guess?</b>

04:17.984 --> 04:19.494
<b>A Demon Lord, eh?</b>

04:19.974 --> 04:22.624
<b>But why a Demon Lord?</b>

04:23.284 --> 04:24.554
<b>I don't know.</b>

04:25.754 --> 04:29.674
<b>The only thing I'm sure of is that</b>

04:30.374 --> 04:33.414
<b>only six of my three hundred 
brethren remain alive.</b>

04:34.144 --> 04:35.374
<b>I see.</b>

04:35.374 --> 04:37.374
<b>No wonder you're upset.</b>

04:39.174 --> 04:41.454
<b>Have you had enough meat, Rimuru?</b>

04:41.454 --> 04:43.554
<b>I'm taking a break.</b>

04:43.554 --> 04:45.744
<b>Your little sister's really something.</b>

04:49.274 --> 04:51.364
<b>She knows a lot about 
medicinal and cooking herbs.</b>

04:51.364 --> 04:53.994
<b>The Goblins took to her immediately.</b>

04:54.464 --> 04:56.434
<b>She was a sheltered child.</b>

04:56.434 --> 04:58.554
<b>She must be happy that 
they're relying on her.</b>

04:59.584 --> 05:02.764
<b>So, what are you guys going to do now?</b>

05:02.764 --> 05:04.504
<b>What do you mean?</b>

05:04.924 --> 05:06.724
<b>I mean your plans for the future.</b>

05:07.464 --> 05:11.514
<b>Whether you rebuild your village 
or relocate to another area,</b>

05:11.514 --> 05:15.034
<b>the fate of your comrades is depending 
on your leadership, right?</b>

05:17.104 --> 05:18.474
<b>That's easy.</b>

05:18.654 --> 05:21.384
<b>We will build our strength 
and take them on again.</b>

05:21.384 --> 05:22.934
<b>Do you know where to find them?</b>

05:27.414 --> 05:29.684
<b><i>He doesn't have a plan at all.</i></b>

05:31.734 --> 05:33.074
<b>Well, I have a suggestion.</b>

05:33.654 --> 05:36.934
<b>Do you guys have any interest 
in being my subordinates?</b>

05:37.954 --> 05:38.934
<b>Subordinates?</b>

05:39.424 --> 05:41.414
<b>Of course, all I can pay you</b>

05:43.124 --> 05:45.504
<b>is guaranteed food, shelter, and clothing.</b>

05:46.084 --> 05:48.104
<b>You need a home base, right?</b>

05:48.104 --> 05:53.224
<b>But that would involve your 
whole village in our revenge.</b>

05:54.494 --> 05:57.974
<b>Well... I'm not just offering 
this as a favor to you guys.</b>

05:59.244 --> 06:02.934
<b>You said thousands of armed 
Orcs attacked you, right?</b>

06:03.744 --> 06:06.674
<b>And there might be a 
Demon Lord pulling the strings.</b>

06:07.564 --> 06:12.944
<b>The Orcs may be seeking dominion 
over the Great Forest of Jura.</b>

06:14.744 --> 06:18.454
<b>This town isn't completely safe, either.</b>

06:19.694 --> 06:24.164
<b>Which is why adding as many to our 
numbers as possible would benefit us.</b>

06:25.594 --> 06:29.624
<b>Plus, if anything happened to 
you guys, I'd fight with you.</b>

06:31.114 --> 06:32.964
<b>I'll never abandon a friend.</b>

06:34.684 --> 06:35.814
<b>I see.</b>

06:37.794 --> 06:39.724
<b>Let me give it some thought.</b>

06:40.204 --> 06:43.134
<b>Sure. Take all the time you 
need to think about it.</b>

06:43.834 --> 06:47.864
<b>Well, I think I'll go get some more meat.</b>

07:00.184 --> 07:01.984
<b>It's not a bad offer.</b>

07:04.164 --> 07:06.494
<b>But it's your choice to make.</b>

07:07.224 --> 07:09.754
<b>We'll do whatever you 
and the princess decide.</b>

07:28.494 --> 07:30.834
<b>If only I were stronger...</b>

07:39.394 --> 07:40.614
<b>Have you decided?</b>

07:41.474 --> 07:43.754
<b>The Ogres are a warring clan.</b>

07:44.314 --> 07:47.814
<b>We aren't against taking to the 
battlefield in service to another.</b>

07:47.814 --> 07:51.054
<b>If our master is strong, we are 
all the more pleased to serve them.</b>

07:54.394 --> 07:58.214
<b>Can our contract last only until 
we take out the Orcs' leader?</b>

07:58.624 --> 08:01.094
<b>You can do whatever you want after that.</b>

08:01.534 --> 08:04.194
<b>You can stay and help us build a nation,</b>

08:04.194 --> 08:05.594
<b>or you can go on your way.</b>

08:13.834 --> 08:16.864
<b>I would like to accept the 
offer you presented last night.</b>

08:17.674 --> 08:21.114
<b>We will hereby serve under you.</b>

08:22.374 --> 08:23.094
<b>Good.</b>

08:24.954 --> 08:27.794
<b><i>I should've given more 
consideration to how he feels.</i></b>

08:28.274 --> 08:30.354
<b><i>I'm sure all he wants is 
to avenge his people now,</i></b>

08:30.354 --> 08:32.104
<b><i>even if it gets him killed.</i></b>

08:33.504 --> 08:39.174
<b><i>He's making this decision as a leader 
who's had to accept his own weakness.</i></b>

08:40.544 --> 08:41.804
<b>Lift your head.</b>

08:45.364 --> 08:49.424
<b>You're all accepted. Call in the others.</b>

08:49.424 --> 08:50.144
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

08:51.734 --> 08:53.274
<b><i>All I can do...</i></b>

08:53.814 --> 08:56.614
<b><i>is make sure he won't regret that decision.</i></b>

09:04.814 --> 09:07.534
<b>I'll give you names to prove 
you're my subordinates.</b>

09:08.934 --> 09:10.484
<b>All of us?</b>

09:11.524 --> 09:13.834
<b>Well, having no name makes 
things tough, doesn't it?</b>

09:15.104 --> 09:16.104
<b>But...</b>

09:16.464 --> 09:18.244
<b>P-Please, wait.</b>

09:18.244 --> 09:21.864
<b>Giving a name comes with great risks.</b>

09:21.864 --> 09:23.214
<b>And to name such superior monstersâ€”</b>

09:23.214 --> 09:26.014
<b>It's fine, really. Don't worry about it.</b>

09:26.334 --> 09:27.444
<b>But...</b>

09:27.444 --> 09:31.374
<b><i>The "risk" is me using too many 
magicules and falling asleep, right?</i></b>

09:31.374 --> 09:34.104
<b><i>There's only six of them 
this time, so it'll be fine.</i></b>

09:34.954 --> 09:37.944
<b>Or do you just not want me to name you?</b>

09:38.184 --> 09:39.744
<b>That isn't...</b>

09:39.744 --> 09:41.064
<b>We have no complaints.</b>

09:41.064 --> 09:42.324
<b>Brother!</b>

09:43.474 --> 09:45.024
<b>We gratefully accept your names.</b>

09:46.054 --> 09:48.324
<b>If this is the young master's will, we accept.</b>

09:50.854 --> 09:52.234
<b>Okay, let's get started.</b>

09:57.834 --> 09:59.634
<b>You are...</b>

10:03.324 --> 10:06.444
<b>Shion, it's time to switch places.</b>

10:06.444 --> 10:10.234
<b>Oh, no, Princess. 
I will look after Great Rimuru.</b>

10:10.234 --> 10:12.324
<b>Please get some rest.</b>

10:13.084 --> 10:15.094
<b>Really, Shion...</b>

10:18.694 --> 10:21.364
<b>Great Rimuru, good morning!</b>

10:21.804 --> 10:24.844
<b>Um... Who are you again?</b>

10:25.744 --> 10:29.464
<b><i>Wait... My memory's a little fuzzy,</i></b>

10:29.464 --> 10:32.794
<b><i>but I think I was about 
to name the Ogres when...</i></b>

10:32.794 --> 10:33.814
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

10:34.304 --> 10:36.744
<b>Have you awakened, Great Rimuru?</b>

10:38.194 --> 10:40.874
<b>You're the "young master" 
of the Ogres, right?</b>

10:40.874 --> 10:41.704
<b>Correct.</b>

10:42.194 --> 10:44.264
<b>I have evolved into a Kijin,</b>

10:44.264 --> 10:47.074
<b>and I have assumed the name 
you gave me: Benimaru.</b>

10:48.944 --> 10:49.784
<b>Oh!</b>

10:50.384 --> 10:54.974
<b>I remember now! I went into sleep 
mode the moment I named him!</b>

10:54.974 --> 10:58.644
<b><i>Wait, what did he say? "Kijin"? Not "Ogre"?</i></b>

10:58.854 --> 11:03.984
<b>Kijin</b>

10:59.084 --> 11:03.524
<b><i>"Kijin" refers to a race of 
beings uncommonly born of Ogres.</i></b>

11:00.564 --> 11:03.984
<b>"Kijin" refers to a race of 
beings uncommonly born of Ogres</b>

11:04.244 --> 11:05.864
<b>Huh...</b>

11:06.304 --> 11:10.214
<b><i>His body looks... a little smaller?</i></b>

11:10.214 --> 11:14.914
<b><i>The amount of magicules in 
him has exploded, though...</i></b>

11:16.084 --> 11:20.084
<b><i>Is this a repeat of the Rigurd shock?!</i></b>

11:20.664 --> 11:24.134
<b><i>This means he evolved from 
an Ogre to a Kijin, right?</i></b>

11:24.564 --> 11:26.774
<b>Great Rimuru, I am Shuna.</b>

11:28.554 --> 11:31.504
<b>I'm so glad to see that you've awakened.</b>

11:31.504 --> 11:32.684
<b><i>Shuna...</i></b>

11:33.494 --> 11:35.654
<b><i>Right, she's the Ogre princess.</i></b>

11:35.654 --> 11:39.184
<b><i>She was already cute, 
but she's even prettier now!</i></b>

11:40.104 --> 11:41.334
<b>I am Shion.</b>

11:41.954 --> 11:46.024
<b>I'm very fond of the name 
you gave me, Great Rimuru.</b>

11:46.894 --> 11:49.234
<b><i>This busty beauty is Shion?</i></b>

11:49.234 --> 11:52.584
<b><i>She looks less wild and more intelligent now.</i></b>

11:53.504 --> 11:59.594
<b>And the one behind Benimaru... 
is the old man who cut off my arm.</b>

12:00.744 --> 12:02.544
<b>Such a mean-spirited remark.</b>

12:02.734 --> 12:06.324
<b>It was I who felt shocked when you 
instantly regenerated your arm.</b>

12:06.974 --> 12:09.474
<b>He looks a lot younger now.</b>

12:09.474 --> 12:12.764
<b>Is that a result of his evolution to Kijin?</b>

12:14.984 --> 12:16.544
<b>And I think you're...</b>

12:16.954 --> 12:19.094
<b>You have given me the name "Souei."</b>

12:20.554 --> 12:24.394
<b>I am glad to see that you 
have recovered, Great Rimuru.</b>

12:24.394 --> 12:26.194
<b>Th-Thanks.</b>

12:26.724 --> 12:29.114
<b><i>Giving a name to a superior monster</i></b>

12:29.114 --> 12:31.534
<b><i>consumes an equally large 
amount of magicules.</i></b>

12:32.524 --> 12:37.734
<b><i>In other words, naming just six of 
them drained almost all my magicules?</i></b>

12:38.334 --> 12:40.864
<b><i>I wish you'd told me that sooner.</i></b>

12:42.394 --> 12:43.734
<b>Where's the sixth one?</b>

12:43.734 --> 12:47.294
<b>Oh, he's been spending a lot 
of time at Kaijin's workshop.</b>

12:47.614 --> 12:49.724
<b>I heard Great Rimuru has awakened!</b>

12:49.724 --> 12:51.844
<b>Ah, there he is.</b>

12:52.274 --> 12:54.154
<b><i>I think he looked like this.</i></b>

12:55.074 --> 12:56.574
<b><i>I wonder how he changed...</i></b>

12:56.574 --> 12:58.144
<b>Great Rimuru!</b>

12:58.694 --> 13:01.054
<b>I'm so glad you're well!</b>

13:02.054 --> 13:04.574
<b>You recognize me, right? I am Kurobe.</b>

13:04.574 --> 13:06.564
<b><i>He looks like an ordinary middle-aged guy!</i></b>

13:06.794 --> 13:07.894
<b><i>So after a hot guy,</i></b>

13:07.894 --> 13:09.214
<b><i>a cute girl,</i></b>

13:09.214 --> 13:10.114
<b><i>a babe,</i></b>

13:10.514 --> 13:11.874
<b><i>a dignified gray,</i></b>

13:11.874 --> 13:13.264
<b><i>and another hot guy...</i></b>

13:13.264 --> 13:15.864
<b><i>He's just a middle-aged guy! What a relief!</i></b>

13:16.524 --> 13:18.124
<b>I hope we'll be good friends, Kurobe!</b>

13:18.124 --> 13:19.374
<b>Sure!</b>

13:25.204 --> 13:26.374
<b><i>Meanwhile...</i></b>

13:27.544 --> 13:30.214
<b><i>The changes occurring in 
the Great Forest of Jura</i></b>

13:30.214 --> 13:32.634
<b><i>continued their invasive progress.</i></b>

13:43.874 --> 13:48.674
<b><i>In the middle of the Great 
Forest of Jura is Lake Siss.</i></b>

13:44.224 --> 13:50.024
<b>\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hLake Siss\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h</b>

13:50.474 --> 13:53.614
<b><i>Vast marshlands surround the lake.</i></b>

13:54.864 --> 13:57.394
<b><i>The Lizardmen control this territory.</i></b>

13:58.644 --> 14:00.494
<b>R-Reporting!</b>

14:00.664 --> 14:03.494
<b>We have spotted an Orc 
army south of Lake Siss!</b>

14:03.814 --> 14:07.004
<b>We believe they intend 
to invade our territory!</b>

14:07.214 --> 14:08.694
<b>Orcs?</b>

14:09.304 --> 14:11.104
<b>Prepare for battle.</b>

14:11.104 --> 14:13.454
<b>We'll beat those pigs senseless.</b>

14:13.454 --> 14:15.264
<b>How many are there?</b>

14:15.514 --> 14:16.704
<b>Well...</b>

14:17.244 --> 14:19.764
<b>The Orc army numbers...</b>

14:20.314 --> 14:22.114
<b>approximately 200,000.</b>

14:23.054 --> 14:26.894
<b>I-Impossible! How can they 
have twice what we have?!</b>

14:27.374 --> 14:31.354
<b>We verified the number several times 
with Magic Sense and Sense Heat Source.</b>

14:31.354 --> 14:34.154
<b>I swear on my life that it is true.</b>

14:35.344 --> 14:36.724
<b>Good work.</b>

14:37.194 --> 14:39.054
<b>You may rest.</b>

14:39.054 --> 14:39.784
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

14:42.704 --> 14:44.594
<b>200,000?</b>

14:45.574 --> 14:51.464
<b>How does one keep such a ridiculous 
number of Orc bellies full?</b>

14:51.774 --> 14:55.674
<b>They're supposed to be an uncoordinated 
lot that does whatever they please.</b>

14:55.674 --> 15:00.374
<b>No one could lead an outrageous 
number like 200,000 of them!</b>

15:00.374 --> 15:04.614
<b>I heard a rumor that they 
destroyed the Ogre village.</b>

15:04.614 --> 15:05.724
<b>They did what?!</b>

15:07.074 --> 15:08.814
<b>The Orc Lord...</b>

15:10.214 --> 15:14.814
<b>If there is an Orc who could command 
a force of 200,000 of his brethren,</b>

15:15.694 --> 15:21.154
<b>it would have to be the unique 
monster of legend, the Orc Lord.</b>

15:23.334 --> 15:25.134
<b>O-Orc Lord?</b>

15:25.134 --> 15:26.664
<b>But that's...</b>

15:27.014 --> 15:29.304
<b>No, if that really is true,</b>

15:29.304 --> 15:34.424
<b>it would explain how he's able to 
command such a huge army of Orcs.</b>

15:34.424 --> 15:36.534
<b>But what would he want?</b>

15:36.534 --> 15:38.674
<b>That doesn't matter!</b>

15:38.674 --> 15:41.314
<b>The question is whether
or not we can defeat them!</b>

15:43.524 --> 15:46.824
<b>If an Orc Lord truly has been born,</b>

15:46.824 --> 15:48.604
<b>it will be difficult for us to win.</b>

15:50.964 --> 15:57.614
<b>The Orc Lord is a true monster that devours 
even the fear and terror of his own allies.</b>

15:59.234 --> 16:01.114
<b>It is only a possibility,</b>

16:01.564 --> 16:04.934
<b>but we must do everything we can possibly do.</b>

16:04.934 --> 16:06.714
<b>And what does that entail?</b>

16:07.154 --> 16:09.494
<b>I suppose we should request backup.</b>

16:10.754 --> 16:11.964
<b>My son!</b>

16:12.424 --> 16:14.344
<b>Is my son here?</b>

16:15.074 --> 16:17.154
<b>I'm right here.</b>

16:21.214 --> 16:26.064
<b>But, Father, must you address 
me in such a boorish manner?</b>

16:26.064 --> 16:31.604
<b>I have a name, Gabiru, which 
was given to me by Lord Gelmud.</b>

16:27.604 --> 16:31.604
<b>Gabiru</b>

16:32.504 --> 16:35.164
<b>What you are called makes no difference.</b>

16:39.354 --> 16:41.744
<b>There is something I need you to do.</b>

16:44.034 --> 16:45.744
<b>What would that be?</b>

16:51.344 --> 16:53.084
<b>You'll have to do better than that!</b>

16:58.654 --> 17:01.424
<b>Well, come on! Strike back!</b>

17:03.984 --> 17:08.524
<b><i>Gobta casually said he wanted to learn 
swordsmanship, and this happened.</i></b>

17:08.944 --> 17:11.644
<b><i>Hakurou is definitely a tough coach.</i></b>

17:13.674 --> 17:16.314
<b>Orc Lord? What's that?</b>

17:16.744 --> 17:20.534
<b>Well, put simply... it's a beast.</b>

17:20.534 --> 17:22.194
<b>That's simple, all right.</b>

17:22.694 --> 17:26.404
<b>It's said that one is born to 
the Orcs every few centuries.</b>

17:27.104 --> 17:28.694
<b>It's a unique monster.</b>

17:28.694 --> 17:30.154
<b>Unique, huh?</b>

17:30.944 --> 17:34.554
<b>They say he devours even his 
own allies' fear and terror,</b>

17:34.554 --> 17:37.814
<b>which makes him an 
unnaturally effective leader.</b>

17:37.814 --> 17:39.174
<b>Yikes.</b>

17:39.664 --> 17:44.244
<b>The Orcs that attacked our village were 
unfazed by the deaths of their own,</b>

17:44.654 --> 17:46.344
<b>so I thought that may be the case.</b>

17:46.344 --> 17:47.684
<b>I see.</b>

17:48.334 --> 17:52.314
<b>Of course, the possibility 
of it is quite low.</b>

17:53.984 --> 17:58.194
<b>Any other ideas why they might 
have attacked your village?</b>

17:58.534 --> 17:59.814
<b>Well...</b>

18:00.574 --> 18:02.574
<b>I'm not sure if there's any connection,</b>

18:03.444 --> 18:07.074
<b>but shortly before the attack, 
a majin visited our village...</b>

18:08.434 --> 18:10.324
<b>I shall name you.</b>

18:10.624 --> 18:14.334
<b>He said that, but he 
sounded too untrustworthy,</b>

18:14.334 --> 18:18.214
<b>so I turned him away, 
and he cursed me as he left.</b>

18:18.554 --> 18:20.424
<b>A majin, huh?</b>

18:20.424 --> 18:23.844
<b>So you think he might have 
a grudge against you?</b>

18:23.844 --> 18:25.314
<b>I had no other choice.</b>

18:25.794 --> 18:28.724
<b>I want no such gift from 
an unsuitable master.</b>

18:29.424 --> 18:33.734
<b>I wouldn't accept a name 
from just anyone, after all.</b>

18:36.774 --> 18:38.894
<b>What was his name again?</b>

18:39.064 --> 18:40.094
<b>I think he said...</b>

18:40.094 --> 18:43.904
<b>Gela... Geli... Gele... Gelo?</b>

18:48.174 --> 18:49.404
<b>Gelmud.</b>

18:49.404 --> 18:51.034
<b>Right, that's it.</b>

18:51.214 --> 18:55.694
<b>Gelmud? I think I've 
heard that name before...</b>

18:57.514 --> 19:01.294
<b>Rigur-kun, who gave your brother his name?</b>

19:01.294 --> 19:06.344
<b>Sir! I'm told he received his name from 
a passing Demon called Lord Gelmud.</b>

19:06.344 --> 19:08.124
<b>He saw promise in him.</b>

19:08.124 --> 19:09.424
<b>Gel...?</b>

19:09.594 --> 19:12.514
<b>Gelmud. He's an officer 
in the Demon Lord's army.</b>

19:13.114 --> 19:14.924
<b>I bet it's the same guy.</b>

19:15.354 --> 19:17.614
<b><i>Does he just go around naming whoever?</i></b>

19:17.614 --> 19:18.774
<b><i>Why?</i></b>

19:19.284 --> 19:21.334
<b>I bring a report, Great Rimuru.</b>

19:21.334 --> 19:22.094
<b>Okay.</b>

19:22.514 --> 19:24.854
<b>I witnessed a group of Lizardmen.</b>

19:24.854 --> 19:27.694
<b>Lizardmen? Not Orcs?</b>

19:27.694 --> 19:28.404
<b>Correct.</b>

19:28.784 --> 19:30.954
<b>Because they make the marshlands their home,</b>

19:30.954 --> 19:33.774
<b>it seemed unnatural to see them near here,</b>

19:33.774 --> 19:35.714
<b>so I had to inform you at once.</b>

19:37.614 --> 19:41.794
<b>They seemed to be attempting negotiations 
with a nearby Goblin village.</b>

19:41.994 --> 19:44.794
<b>They may one day come here, as well.</b>

19:45.174 --> 19:46.284
<b>I see...</b>

19:46.754 --> 19:48.444
<b>Lizardmen...</b>

20:06.224 --> 20:08.864
<b>Honestly, that father of mine...</b>

20:09.564 --> 20:12.864
<b>Visit the local Goblin villages 
and enlist their aid.</b>

20:13.214 --> 20:14.464
<b>Indeed!</b>

20:15.354 --> 20:19.994
<b>It is not the way of the proud 
Lizardman race to fear mere Orcs!</b>

20:20.794 --> 20:24.754
<b>And he used to be such a great man...</b>

20:24.934 --> 20:28.274
<b>Hey, Sir Gabiru, when are you 
gonna become the chieftain?</b>

20:30.974 --> 20:35.124
<b>Oh, no. My comment may have 
been a bit disrespectful,</b>

20:35.124 --> 20:38.264
<b>but I still fall far short of my father.</b>

20:38.454 --> 20:39.734
<b>Really?</b>

20:39.734 --> 20:43.794
<b>But as you are now, I bet you're just as 
mighty as the chieftain during his glory days!</b>

20:43.794 --> 20:44.604
<b>I agree.</b>

20:44.994 --> 20:46.604
<b>No, really, I...</b>

20:47.034 --> 20:49.324
<b>I mean, you're named, after all!</b>

20:49.324 --> 20:53.054
<b>Yes, and you are unequaled 
in the art of the spear.</b>

20:53.054 --> 20:55.844
<b>If you don't take your 
stand now, when will you?</b>

21:01.584 --> 21:03.444
<b><i>Eh? What is this?</i></b>

21:03.914 --> 21:09.604
<b><i>Could it be... that I'm 
actually pretty great?!</i></b>

21:10.644 --> 21:11.754
<b>You are right.</b>

21:12.194 --> 21:13.824
<b>My father has grown old.</b>

21:13.824 --> 21:15.544
<b>Even if I must be a bit forceful,</b>

21:15.544 --> 21:20.284
<b>I will show him that I have 
strength worthy of a chieftain!</b>

21:21.414 --> 21:25.154
<b>Then he can retire with peace of mind.</b>

21:25.154 --> 21:26.024
<b>You mean...</b>

21:29.084 --> 21:30.074
<b>Yes!</b>

21:34.204 --> 21:36.684
<b>Once I drive away the Orc army,</b>

21:36.684 --> 21:40.494
<b>I will take my place as the 
next Lizardman chieftain!</b>

21:40.694 --> 21:43.324
<b>That's our Sir Gabiru! Woohoo!</b>

21:43.324 --> 21:44.204
<b>You're on fire!</b>

21:44.204 --> 21:45.624
<b>You will surely be chieftain!</b>

21:46.834 --> 21:57.554
<b>Gabiru! Gabiru! Gabiru!</b>

21:50.294 --> 21:51.814
<b>Let's go!</b>

21:53.664 --> 21:57.554
<b>Follow me, men! Your future is bright!</b>

21:59.304 --> 22:02.814
<b>Gabiru! Gabiru! Gabiru!</b>

23:35.824 --> 23:38.504
<b><i>Next time, "Gabiru Is Here!"</i></b>

23:36.074 --> 23:39.944
Gabiru <u>Is Here!</u>
