		dt What is the Anime Notifier project?
		dd.
			Anime Notifier takes all of your anime from a list provider and tries to match them with an anime provider,
			then retrieves airing dates for each of your anime. The Anime Notifier project is also an effort to unify the
			communities of multiple anime related sites on one platform.
		
		dt Is it finished yet?
		dd.
			Software usually goes through 3 stages: Alpha, Beta and Release.
			Only the last stage is considered to be stable and fully functional.
			Anime Notifier is currently in Alpha stage, therefore it's far away from being finished yet.
		
		dt Why is my list not loading?
		dd Make sure you selected the correct list provider and also entered your username (not a link) for that site.
		
		dt Which apps can I use?
		dd Currently there is only a Chrome extension but support for Firefox and Android is going to come soon.
		
		dt When do you send push notifications?
		dd.
			Let's say you're watching an anime which has 7 episodes available and you watched those 7.
			The next day Anime Notifier discovers that the next episode has been released on the anime provider you selected and sends you a notification.
			Therefore you need to have watched the latest episode of that anime to receive notifications.
			
		dt Why do I get different accounts for Google and Facebook login?
		dd
			| Anime Notifier can't determine whether a Google user who logged in earlier is the same person who just used a Facebook login or vice versa.
			| Currently the only way to link those to the same Anime Notifier account is to make sure you use the 
			span.main-point same email address
			|  on both services.
			| In the future you will be able to link any number of accounts on the settings page.
		
		dt Is Anime Notifier free to use?
		dd
			span.main-point Alpha and Beta test are completely free for anyone.
			|  At release I'll need to charge a little fee to keep the servers and the project alive.
			| The project code is managed only by myself and I'd like to provide you with high quality software that everyone likes using.
			| My dream is to work fulltime on this project and listen to community feedback to work on improved solutions together.
			| The price will be 9.95 $ for 12 months (6.95 $ if you were an alpha/beta tester before).
			| Primary payment methods will be PayPal and Stripe, however I'm not going to leave you in the dark if you don't own any of those.
