		dt What is the Anime Notifier project?
		dd.
			Anime Notifier takes all of your anime from a list provider and tries to match them with an anime provider,
			then retrieves airing dates for each of your anime. The Anime Notifier project is also an effort to unify the
			communities of multiple anime related sites on one platform.
		
		dt Why is my list not loading?
		dd Make sure you selected the correct list provider and also entered your username (not a link) for that site.
		
		dt Which apps can I use?
		dd
			ul
				li Chrome Extension
				li Firefox Extension
				li Android Web App
		
		dt When do you send push notifications?
		dd.
			Let's say you're watching an anime which has 7 episodes available and you watched those 7.
			The next day Anime Notifier discovers that the next episode has been released on the anime provider you selected and sends you a notification.
			Therefore you need to have watched the latest episode of that anime to receive notifications.
			
		dt Why do I get different accounts for Google and Facebook login?
		dd
			| Anime Notifier can't determine whether a Google user who logged in earlier is the same person who just used a Facebook login or vice versa.
			| Currently the only way to link those to the same Anime Notifier account is to make sure you use the 
			span.main-point same email address
			|  on both services.
			| In the future you will be able to link any number of accounts on the settings page.
		
		dt Is Anime Notifier free to use?
		dd
			span.main-point
				| Alpha and Beta test are completely free for everyone. 
			| At release I might need to charge a little fee to keep the servers and the project alive.

			dt Why is my profile not shown on the user list?
			dd In order to appear in the user list you need to 
				span.main-point set a username
				|  on Anime Notifier, enter the 
				span.main-point username for the list provider
				|  you selected and 
				span.main-point have a gravatar image
				| .
		
		dt I've set my gravatar picture for my email but it doesn't show up?
		dd 
			if user
				| Remember to add 
				span.user-data= user.email
				|  as an email address to your gravatar account. 
			| Gravatar needs some time to update its cache.
			| You need to wait a few minutes before it shows up.
